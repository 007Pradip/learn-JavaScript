# Use of array method

JavaScript arrays have many useful methods. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

### Array Methods

* `push()`: adds one or more elements to the end of an array
* `pop()`: removes the last element from an array
* `shift()`: removes the first element from an array
* `unshift()`: adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array
* `splice()`: adds or removes elements from a specific position in an array
* `slice()`: returns a subset of an array
* `indexOf()`: returns the index of the first occurrence of a value in an array
* `includes()`: checks if an array includes a certain value
* `forEach()`: executes a function for each element in an array
* `map()`: creates a new array with the results of applying a function to each element in the original array
* `filter()`: creates a new array with all elements that pass a test implemented by a function
* `reduce()`: applies a function to each element in an array and reduces it to a single value
* `sort()`: sorts the elements of an array in place
* `reverse()`: reverses the order of the elements in an array

Here's an example of using some of these methods:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.push(6); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
numbers.pop(); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(x => x * 2); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(x => x % 2 === 0); // [2, 4]
```
# Destructuring in JavaScript

Destructuring is a way to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables. It's a convenient way to work with complex data structures and is often used in functional programming.

In JavaScript, destructuring is a convenient way to extract values from arrays, objects, or function return values into distinct variables. It helps simplify the process of extracting data from complex structures.

Here's an example of array destructuring:

```javascript
const fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange'];
const [firstFruit, secondFruit, thirdFruit] = fruits;

console.log(firstFruit); // Output: "Apple"
console.log(secondFruit); // Output: "Banana"
console.log(thirdFruit); // Output: "Orange"
```

Here's an example of object destructuring:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  city: 'New York'
};

const { name, age, city } = person;

console.log(name); // Output: "John"
console.log(age); // Output: 30
console.log(city); // Output: "New York"
```

In the above examples, the values from the array or object are assigned to variables with the same name. If you want to give the variables different names, you can do so like this:

```javascript
const [firstFruit, , thirdFruit] = fruits;
const { name: personName, age: personAge, city: personCity } = person;
```

In the above examples, the underscore `_` can be used to ignore a value. For example:

```javascript
const [firstFruit, , _] = fruits;
```

This will assign the first and third fruits to variables, but ignore the second fruit.

Destructuring can also be used in function parameters to extract values from the function arguments:

```javascript
function getPersonInfo({ name, age, city }) {
  console.log(`Name: ${name}`);
  console.log(`Age: ${age}`);
  console.log(`City: ${city}`);
}

const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  city: 'New York'
};

getPersonInfo(person);
```

In the above example, the `getPersonInfo` function uses object destructuring to extract the `name`, `age`, and `city` properties from the `person` object.

Destructuring is a powerful feature that can simplify code and make it more readable.

# Arrays and Objects in JavaScript

In JavaScript, arrays and objects are two of the most common data structures. Arrays are used to store a collection of values, while objects are used to store key-value pairs.

Arrays are ordered collections of values, while objects are unordered collections of key-value pairs.

Arrays are used to store a collection of values, while objects are used to store a collection of key-value pairs.

# Object in JavaScript

In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs. It is a dynamic data structure that allows you to store and retrieve data in a structured way.

An object is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value.

In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs. It is a dynamic data structure that allows you to store and retrieve data in a structured way.
