# Use of array method

JavaScript arrays have many useful methods. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

### Array Methods

* `push()`: adds one or more elements to the end of an array
* `pop()`: removes the last element from an array
* `shift()`: removes the first element from an array
* `unshift()`: adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array
* `splice()`: adds or removes elements from a specific position in an array
* `slice()`: returns a subset of an array
* `indexOf()`: returns the index of the first occurrence of a value in an array
* `includes()`: checks if an array includes a certain value
* `forEach()`: executes a function for each element in an array
* `map()`: creates a new array with the results of applying a function to each element in the original array
* `filter()`: creates a new array with all elements that pass a test implemented by a function
* `reduce()`: applies a function to each element in an array and reduces it to a single value
* `sort()`: sorts the elements of an array in place
* `reverse()`: reverses the order of the elements in an array

Here's an example of using some of these methods:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.push(6); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
numbers.pop(); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(x => x * 2); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(x => x % 2 === 0); // [2, 4]
```
Let me know if you have any specific questions about these methods or if you'd like more information!
